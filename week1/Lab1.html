        <h2> FUN FACT OF THE DAY ~ A house cat is genetically 95.6% tiger  </h2>

    <p>There are over 100 different types of cat breeds both natural and man-made breeds. Every single one is different and unique in its own way. For example, the most popular cat breed is a Ragdoll and a Maine Coon.
        The two main groups of cats in the family are roaring and purr. The domestic cat is well suited for two main purposes: friendship and control of pests. Owners can choose a cat based on which of these purposes is most important to them. Cats are often known by a simple physical trait, such as colour, coat pattern, body size, or hair length, because breed differences might be modest, especially compared to dog breed differences.
         Cats are commonly found, advertised, and wanted by several categories, such as "black," "orange tabby," "longhaired," and "shorthaired."  </p>
